## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Following the workflow shared by Sanskar Sir in the bootcamp, I used:

* **Firebase Studio:** Used as an AI-powered IDE to generate and refine code using Gemini models.
* **Firebase Firestore:** Integrated as a real-time database to manage app data.
* **Google AI Studio:** Leveraged for advanced AI logic and understanding multimodal prompts (like gesture-based logic explained in the session).
* **Vercel:** Used for instant deployment and hosting of the web app.
* **GitHub:** Used for code management and version control.
* **Dribbble:** Used for UI/UX design inspiration to create a modern look.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-time Data:** Instant updates using Firebase backend.
* **AI-Driven Logic:** Complex functions generated and optimized through effective prompting.
* **Responsive UI:** A clean interface designed to work on all screen sizes.
* **Vibe Coding Workflow:** Followed the structured approach of Planning -> Prompting -> Refining -> Shipping.

## 🎓 Learning from the Bootcamp
In this bootcamp with Shiva Sir and Sanskar Sir, I learned:
1. How to use **Vibe Coding** to bridge the gap between an idea and a working product.
2. The art of writing precise prompts to get high-quality code from AI.
3. Deploying full-stack apps live in minutes using Vercel.
